# Tanzania-Water-Well-Project

## Overview 

Tanzania is in the midst of a water crisis: 4 million people in the country do not have access to a source of safe water, and 30 million people lack access to improved sanitation. People living in such circumstances, particulary women and children, usually bear the responsibility of collecting water in their communities, spending a significant amount of time traveling long distances to collect water several trips each day.

The objective of this project is to use **Random Forest**, a powerful ensemble method to perform a **ternary classification** of the functionality of the water wells in Tanzania.
